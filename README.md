The application identifies the fastest route between any two London underground stations. It also takes account of any out of service stations or closed lines. The program consists of three main divisions namely data structure, algorithm and Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Data Structure: This division deals with the construction of the graph required for the algorithm. Three CSV files namely londonstations, londonconnections and londonlines are being imported as the inputs to the program initially.

Algorithm Division: Here the logic of identifying the fastest route between the 'From and To station' has been handled.

GUI DIvision: This portion validates the input data received from the user to make user that user has entered a valid data. After the validation is successful, the program will execute the alogirthm to find the fastest route.

Tkinter App Design:
The tkinter app has two windows namely 'home page' for handling unavailable lines / stations and 'submit page' for entering from and to stations to get the fastest route.
